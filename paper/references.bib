	abstract = {Several algorithms build on the perfect phylogeny model to infer evolutionary trees. This problem is particularly hard when evolutionary trees are inferred from the fraction of genomes that have mutations in different positions, across different samples. Existing algorithms might do extensive searches over the space of possible trees. At the center of these algorithms is a projection problem that assigns a fitness cost to phylogenetic trees. In order to perform a wide search over the space of the trees, it is critical to solve this projection problem fast. In this paper, we use Moreau's decomposition for proximal operators, and a tree reduction scheme, to develop a new algorithm to compute this projection. Our algorithm terminates with an exact solution in a finite number of steps, and is extremely fast. In particular, it can search over all evolutionary trees with fewer than 11 nodes, a size relevant for several biological problems (more than 2 billion trees) in about 2 hours.},

We derive a combinatorial characterization of the solutions to this problem and show that the problem is {NP}-complete. We derive an integer linear programming solution to the {VAF} factorization problem in the case of error-free data and extend this solution to real data with a probabilistic model for errors. The resulting {AncesTree} algorithm is better able to identify ancestral relationships between individual mutations than existing approaches, particularly in ultra-deep sequencing data when high read counts for mutations yield high confidence {VAFs}.Availability and implementation: An implementation of {AncesTree} is available at: http://compbio.cs.brown.edu/software.Contact:  braphael@brown.{eduSupplementary} information:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

The characters are binary and directed, i.e., a species can only gain characters. The difference from standard perfect phylogeny is that for some species the state of some characters is unknown. The question is whether one can complete the missing states in a way admitting a perfect phylogeny. The problem arises in classical phylogenetic studies, when some states are missing or undetermined. Quite recently, studies that infer phylogenies using inserted repeat elements in {DNA} gave rise to the same problem. The best known algorithm for the problem requires O(n2m) time for m characters and n species. We provide a near optimal ÕO(nm)-time algorithm for the problem.},

However, sequencing data from bulk tumor samples often have considerable ambiguity in clonal composition, complicating the inference of ancestral relationships between clones. We introduce Cancer Analysis of Longitudinal Data through Evolutionary Reconstruction ({CALDER}), an algorithm to infer phylogenetic trees from longitudinal bulk {DNA} sequencing data. {CALDER} explicitly models a longitudinally observed phylogeny incorporating constraints that longitudinal sampling imposes on phylogeny reconstruction. We show on simulated bulk tumor data that longitudinal constraints substantially reduce ambiguity in phylogeny reconstruction and that {CALDER} outperforms existing methods that do not leverage this longitudinal information. On real data from two chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, we find that {CALDER} reconstructs more plausible and parsimonious phylogenies than existing methods, with {CALDER} phylogenies containing fewer tumor clones per sample. {CALDER}’s use of longitudinal information will be advantageous in further studies of tumor heterogeneity and evolution.},

We formalize this as the Enumeration Variant Allele Frequency Factorization Problem and provide a novel proof for an upper bound on the number of possible phylogenies consistent with a given dataset. In addition, we propose and assess two methods for increasing the robustness and performance of an existing graph based phylogenetic inference method. We apply our approaches to noisy simulated data and find that low coverage and high noise make it more difficult to identify phylogenies.

	abstract = {Cancers are composed of genetically distinct subpopulations of malignant cells. {DNA}-sequencing data can be used to determine the somatic point mutations specific to each population and build clone trees describing the evolutionary relationships between them. These clone trees can reveal critical points in disease development and inform treatment. Pairtree is a new method that constructs more accurate and detailed clone trees than previously possible using variant allele frequency data from one or more bulk cancer samples. It does so by first building a Pairs Tensor that captures the evolutionary relationships between pairs of subpopulations, and then it uses these relations to constrain clone trees and infer violations of the infinite sites assumption. Pairtree can accurately build clone trees using up to 100 samples per cancer that contain 30 or more subclonal populations. On 14 B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemias, Pairtree replicates or improves upon expert-derived clone tree reconstructions.Clone trees illustrate the evolutionary history of a cancer and can provide insights into how the disease changed through time (e.g., between diagnosis and relapse). Pairtree uses {DNA}-sequencing data from many samples of the same cancer to build more detailed and accurate clone trees than previously possible.See related commentary by Miller, p. 176.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 171.},
