## Acute B Lineage Leukemia (B-ALL) Phylogenies

Here, we provide the phylogenies inferred by `fastbe`,
along with the pre-processed data used to infer them,
for the acute B lineage leukemia (B-ALL) dataset [^1].
The original pre-processed data with excluded copy number impacted
mutations was originally performed in the Pairtree manuscript [^2].

The "raw" input files from [^2] are provided in the `input` directory. 
The preprocessed data used to infer the phylogenies with `fastbe` are 
provided in the `preprocessed` directory.
The mutation phylogenies and mutation clusterings inferred by `fastbe` 
are provided in the `phylogenies` directory.
